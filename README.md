# Our Sem 1 Assignment- Make a simple search engine
### Credit to my teammates!
Thanks to Fahad, Yong Ming, Wei Hao and Srija for contributing to the project so we can have this wonderful search engine presented to our 
lecturer.
<br/>
This search engine can only perform simple search based on certain keywords. 
>To try, go to GOOGOL.java file, run it and type "shop" into the search box.
<br/>
There are calculator and translator built into this search engine.
The part I coded is the logic behind calculator and tic-tac-toc.
<br/><br/>
Have Fun!
